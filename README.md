# Machine Learning Algorithms with Jupyter Notebooks
## Overview
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate various machine learning algorithms, implemented using both scikit-learn (sklearn) and from scratch by creating Python functions. It covers both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.

## What You Can Learn
**Supervised Learning**: Understand and implement algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees.

**Unsupervised Learning**: Explore algorithms such as K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

**From Scratch Implementations**: Gain insights into the inner workings of machine learning algorithms by implementing them from scratch using Python.

**Using scikit-learn**: Learn how to efficiently use scikit-learn for implementing machine learning algorithms.
